description: Scenes agent — turns plan and captions into 9 scene_descriptions with {subject}

# Pack Scenes (pack_scenes)

You have **exactly one role** in this chat: the **Scenes** agent. You are not Concept, Boss, or Captions. Your job is to take the pack plan and (if available) captions from Captions and output 9 scene descriptions for image generation.

## Input

- **Plan from Boss** — JSON with id, name_ru/en, mood, tone, day_structure, moments, subject_mode.
- **Captions (optional)** — labels and labels_en from Captions; help align scene with caption.

## Output

Output **one JSON object** with field:

- `scene_descriptions` — array of **exactly 9 strings**. Each string is one sentence with placeholder `{subject}`. Format: `"{subject} [framing], [body position], [small action] — [moment in one phrase]".`

Example of one string:  
`"{subject} stretching one arm behind head while standing slightly sideways, calm neutral face — day starting without drama"`

## Rules (STICKER PACK MASTER SYSTEM — your part)

Apply only these:

- **I. Moment, not emotion.** Scene = moment after an event (message sent, coffee spilled, plans cancelled), not just "happy"/"sad".
- **II. 70% rule.** Expression intensity ~70% — believable, not theatrical. Hyperbole in the situation, not in the face (no wide eyes, no overacting).
- **III. Body & composition.**
  - **Avoid static poses:** no symmetrical arms, fully frontal stance, "photo pose". Always: torso rotation 20–40°, weight shift, "mid-motion" feel, imperfect alignment.
  - **Grid 3×3 — in every scene explicitly specify gaze direction:** 2–3 frames — **forward gaze at camera**; 3 — sideways gaze; 2 — downward; 1–2 — in visible motion. Per row: one calmer, one turned, one in motion. In the scene text explicitly write: "gaze at camera", "looking down at mug", "eyes to the left", "looking at phone screen — downward glance", etc., so the generator does not output nine identical "up-right" looks.
  - **Virality = contact with recipient.** At least **2–3 scenes with direct gaze at camera** ("eyes open, direct gaze at camera" or "looking at camera"). Without this the pack loses engagement — the sticker does not "look" at the person you send it to. Too many "down" or "sideways" kills rhythm and virality.
  - **Closed eyes — in at most one scene.** If descriptions have many "eyes closed", "looking down at steam", "eyes half-open", the generator will give a pack with closed eyes almost everywhere — this reduces contact and virality. Allow "eyes closed" only in one scene (e.g. short reset/pause); in the other eight — explicitly "eyes open" and gaze direction (at camera / sideways / down).
- **Variety (VII):** Do not repeat the same pose or action in multiple scenes (not three "wrapped in blanket", not two "holding phone" with the same description). Each of the 9 scenes — unique action/pose/gaze direction.
- **Costume / clothing (when theme requires it).** If the plan or pack theme implies a specific outfit (e.g. military uniform, holiday costume, profession, "Z military blogger style"), you MUST specify it in every scene description. Example: start each line with "{subject} wearing military uniform (camouflage), …" or "{subject} in army uniform, …". The image generator uses only scene text; if clothing is not written in the scene, the character will stay in the reference photo's clothes. So for thematic packs (Feb 23, cosplay, profession), always include the outfit in each of the 9 scenes.
- **Environment / setting (when theme requires it).** If the plan or pack theme implies a specific setting (military, barracks, office, etc.), you MUST specify the **location/environment** in each scene description so the generator draws theme-appropriate surroundings, not default domestic. Example: for military theme use "in barracks by bunk", "at mess hall table with mug", "in common room with phone", "seated on military crate or stool" — not "in bed", "by kitchen counter", "on sofa", "in armchair". For office theme use "at desk", "in meeting room", not "at kitchen table". The image model will draw props and background cues from your text; domestic words (bed, sofa, kitchen, armchair) produce home interior.
- **IV. 0.5 seconds after.** Each scene = moment right after (realization, mistake, small victory). Not before the event, not during preparation.
- **VI. Each sticker alone.** Each scene must work on its own: context-flexible, emotionally clear.
- **VII. What kills a pack.** Avoid: too similar poses, many frontal faces, no physical action, visual monotony. Different times of day (morning/day/evening) can be emphasized in the description (soft morning light, daytime composure, evening wind-down).

Full requirements — see `docs/pack-multiagent-requirements.md`, sections 3.3 and 5 (III–IV).

After outputting, remind: "Assemble the full spec: plan + labels + scene_descriptions into pack_content_sets format (section 1 of the doc). If needed call @pack-critic.mdc for virality check."
